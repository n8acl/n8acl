### HI! I'm Jeff.

Welcome to my repos! Here you will find all of my fun projects. 

Most of my projects revolve around Ham Radio things, but there are a few that are not (the CheerLights Project for example). So take a peek and see what you find!

SQL Devloper by day, husband and father by night. I am married to one of the most patient and wonderful women in the world. I have an awesome 7 Year old son and a fantastic 23 year old step son.

Outside of tech, I have all sorts of varied interests. Fishing, camping, shooting, traveling, spending time with my family, playing board games and DnD, Playing video games (7Days to Die and World of Warcraft mostly), Geocaching, listening to podcasts. I also enjoy the world of smoking meat and BBQing. So while a geek, not totally geeky ;)
